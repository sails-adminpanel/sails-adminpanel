## Installation

To install this hook, you will need to run:

```bash
npm install sails-adminpanel
```

### Configuration
Then you will need to create a config file for the admin panel generator into `config/adminpanel.js`
For use Typescript look below

This is an example of this file:

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports.adminpanel = {
    models: {

        pages: {

            title: 'Pages',
            model: 'Page',

            list: {
                fields: {
                    id: 'ID',
                    name: 'Article name'
                }
            },

            edit: {
                fields: {
                    name: 'Article name',
                    content: {
                        type: 'wysiwyg',
                        title: 'Article body'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

And your admin panel will be accessible under: `http://127.0.0.1:port/admin`

## Documentation & Types

For comprehensive information on configuration and usage, it is highly recommended to refer to the [docs](https://github.com/adminization/adminizer/tree/main/docs) folder within the project repository. The documentation provides detailed insights into various aspects of the admin panel, including configuration options and usage guidelines.

When working with TypeScript in the project, it is advisable to explore the type definitions located in the `/interfaces/adminpanelConfig.d.ts` file. This TypeScript definition file outlines the types and structures associated with the admin panel configuration. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the available options and ensuring type safety when configuring the admin panel.

> **TypeScript Typings:**
> If you need type definitions, you should import them directly from `adminizer`.
> The sails-adminpanel wrapper no longer contains any typings or type helpers.


For projects utilizing TypeScript, consider the following example:

```typescript
import { ModelConfig, AdminpanelConfig } from "adminizer";

let models: { [key: string]: ModelConfig } = {
  // Define your model configurations here
};

var config: AdminpanelConfig = {
  //auth: true,
  dashboard: {
    autoloadWidgetsPath: 'api/dashboardWidgets',
    defaultWidgets: ['reload_website']
  },
  brand: {
    link: {
      title: 'SailsJS adminpanel',
      id: "brand_link",
      link: "/admin"
    }
  }
};

module.exports.adminpanel = config;
```

This TypeScript example demonstrates how to structure model configurations and the overall admin panel configuration. Utilizing TypeScript enhances code clarity, provides autocompletion support, and helps prevent potential configuration errors.


## Problems

> **ESM Import Issue:**
> Please note that this project has a known issue with ESM imports.
> To ensure proper functionality, it is recommended to run the project using [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx).


## Modules

To use the modules, you need to embed the code in **bootstrap** sails.
```javascript
sails.on('Adminpanel:afterHook:loaded', () => {
	const adminizer = sails.hooks.adminpanel.adminizer;

	adminizer.emitter.on('adminizer:loaded', () => {
		const policies = adminizer.config.policies;

		const moduleHandler = (req, res) => {
			if (req.adminizer.config.auth.enable && !req.user) {
				return res.redirect(`${req.adminizer.config.routePrefix}/model/userap/login`);
			}

			return req.Inertia.render({
				component: 'module',
				props: {
					moduleComponent: `/public/ComponentB.es.js`,
					message: 'Hello from Adminizer',
				}
			});
		};

		adminizer.app.all(
			`${adminizer.config.routePrefix}/module-test`,
			adminizer.policyManager.bindPolicies(policies, moduleHandler)
		);
	})
})
```

Through **props**, you must pass the public path to the assembled React component (see [docs](https://github.com/adminization/adminizer/tree/main/docs)). The remaining options in **props** may vary depending on the tasks. For example: `message: 'Hello from Adminizer'`
