- createItem(data: T): Promise<T>: A method that creates a new item with the specified data.
- updateItem(id: string | number, type: string, data: T): Promise<T>: A method that updates the item with the specified id.
- updateModelItems(modelId: string | number, type: string, data: T): Promise<T>: A method that updates all items in the tree after updating the model.
- getitemTypes(): BaseItem<Item>[]: A method that returns an array of BaseItem<Item> objects.
- search(s: string, hasExtras: boolean = true): Promise<T[]>: A method that searches for items in the catalog.
- static buildTree(items: Item[]): Item[]: A static method that builds a tree from an array of items.

### Constructor

The constructor takes an array of BaseItem<any> objects and initializes the catalog with them. It also binds the access rights for the catalog.

## BaseItem class documentation

This is an abstract class that serves as a base for all catalog items. It defines the common properties and methods that all catalog items should have.

### Properties

- type: An abstract property that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the type of the item.
- name: An abstract property that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the name of the catalog.
- isGroup: An abstract property that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents whether the item is a group or not.
- allowedRoot: An abstract property that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents whether it is allowed to add an element to the root.
- icon: An abstract property that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the icon of the item.
- actionHandlers: An array of action handlers that will be available for all items.

### Methods

- addActionHandler(contextHandler: ActionHandler): Adds a new action handler to the list of available action handlers.
- _enrich(item: T): Adds the required fields to the item.
- _find(itemId: string | number, catalogId: string): Finds an item by its id and enriches it with the required fields.
- find(itemId: string | number, catalogId: string): An abstract method that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the logic of finding an item by its id.
- update(itemId: string | number, data: T, catalogId: string): An abstract method that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the logic of updating an item.
- updateModelItems(modelId: string | number, data: any, catalogId: string): An abstract method that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the logic of updating model items.
- create(data: T, catalogId: string): An abstract method that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the logic of creating a new item.
- deleteItem(itemId: string | number, catalogId: string): An abstract method that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the logic of deleting an item.
- getAddHTML(loc: string): An abstract method that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the logic of getting the HTML for adding a new item.
- getEditHTML(id: string | number, catalogId: string, loc: string, modelId?: string | number): An abstract method that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the logic of getting the HTML for editing an item.
- _getChilds(parentId: string | number | null, catalogId: string): Finds all child items of a parent item and enriches them with the required fields.
- getChilds(parentId: string | number | null, catalogId: string): An abstract method that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the logic of finding child items of a parent item.
- search(s: string, catalogId: string): An abstract method that should be implemented in each concrete class. It represents the logic of searching for items.

## AbstractGroup class documentation

This is an abstract class that extends the BaseItem class. It represents a group of catalog items.

### Properties

- type: A property that represents the type of the item. It is set to "group".
- isGroup: A property that represents whether the item is a group or not. It is set to true.
- icon: A property that represents the icon of the item. It is set to "folder".

## AbstractItem class documentation

This is an abstract class that extends the BaseItem class. It represents a single catalog item.

### Properties

- isGroup: A property that represents whether the item is a group or not. It is set to false.

***

## ActionHandler Class Documentation

This class represents an abstract base class for handling actions in a system. It defines the structure and methods that any concrete action handler class must implement.

### Abstract Properties

- type: An abstract property that defines the type of action. It can be one of the following values: "basic", "json-forms", "external", "link", or "partial".
- displayContext: An abstract property that determines whether the action should be displayed in the context menu section.
- displayTool: An abstract property that determines whether the action should be displayed in the toolbox section.
- uiSchema: An abstract property that represents the UI schema for "json-forms" type actions.
- jsonSchema: An abstract property that represents the JSON schema for "json-forms" type actions.
- selectedItemTypes: A property that defines the types of elements for which the action can be used.
- id: An abstract property that represents the unique identifier for the action.
- icon: An abstract property that represents the icon for the action. It can be a URL or an ID.
- name: An abstract property that represents the name of the action.

### Abstract Methods

- getPopUpHTML(data?: any): Promise<string>: An abstract method that returns the HTML content for the pop-up. This method is used for "json-forms" and "external" type actions.
- getLink(data?: any): Promise<string>: An abstract method that returns the link for the "link" type actions.
- handler(items: Item[], data?: any): Promise<void>: An abstract method that represents the implementation of a method that will do something with the selected items.

### Notes

- The "json-forms" type actions require a UI schema and a JSON schema.
- The "external" type actions use the getPopUpHTML method to display the HTML content in a pop-up.
- The "link" type actions use the getLink method to return a link.
- The handler method is responsible for performing the actual action on the selected items.

This method returns all catalogs in the list.

Returns:

- An array of AbstractCatalog instances.

#### getCatalog(slug: string)

This method finds a catalog by its slug.
